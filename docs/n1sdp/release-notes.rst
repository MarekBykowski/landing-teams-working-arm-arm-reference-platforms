Precautions
-----------
- The system thermal monitoring and control features are not yet calibrated,
  therefore do not operate the unit above room temperature (approximately 25Â°C):

  - The thermal shutdown features are currently disabled.
  - The chassis fan speed is currently fixed.

- The N1SDP is intended for use within a laboratory or engineering development
  environment. Do not use the N1SDP near equipment that is sensitive to
  electromagnetic emissions, for example, medical equipment.

- Never subject the board to high electrostatic potentials.
  Observe Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) precautions when handling any board.

  - Always wear a grounding strap when handling the board.
  - Avoid touching the component pins or any other metallic elements.

- Note: The case front panel USB 3.0 ports and & audio jacks are NOT connected/usable.
  They will be removed on later versions.

PCIe Testing
------------
Following are the PCIe Cards tested - PCIe and CCIX slot:
- DW-PCIe-M2(Ver A) with Samsung EVO 970 Pro NVMe M.2 (GEN3 x4)
- TUSB7340 DEMO EVM REV C USB hub card (GEN2 x1)
- Mellanox ConnectX-5
- PEXSAT34 - Two sata controller behind switch (GEN2 X2)


Known Issues or limitations
---------------------------
- To boot a standard distribution on N1SDP platform the kernel must be patched
  with the PCIe quirks. See the article `PCIE`_
